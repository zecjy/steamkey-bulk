# steamkey-bulk
NodeJS steam key bulk activator.
It is a tool which lets you activate multiple or single key's on steam. It includes an account manager and doesn't require a running steam instance. So you can add accounts and choose on which you want to activate a key via CLI. Because it is written in nodeJS it should be easy to implement it in other projects (I might build a webinterface).
# Installation
Download all files, run ```npm install``` to download all dependencies. Then you can start via ```node app help``` and see all available commands.
